"""
Human-in-the-loop implementation for DSPy agents.

This module provides the core infrastructure for inserting human feedback and decision-making
into automated DSPy agent workflows using a unified requester pattern.

The human-in-the-loop pattern allows agents to:
- Request clarification when uncertain
- Ask for approval before taking actions  
- Gather additional context from domain experts
- Involve humans in complex decision-making processes
